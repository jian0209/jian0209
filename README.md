Welcome to my digital dimension, where conventional logic meets the unexpected twists of creativity.

Try to blink your eyes to view the above "star rain", what did you see? it's my name!! haha

"Here is the place where code meets romantic, and every commit tells a story."

## 🚀 Mission Statement

In the pursuit of technological advancements, I navigate the cosmos of code, exploring unknown territories and pioneering solutions that might just be ahead of our time.

### 💡 Innovations & Inventions

- **[My Brag List](https://github.com/jian0209/brag-list)** - my learning brag list and to do list for monitoring the current process of learning
- **[Proxy Server](https://github.com/jian0209/proxy-with-google-code)** - The proxy server that required 2fa to request
- **[Sql Dump With Progress](https://github.com/jian0209/sqldump-with-progress)** - This is the script that support progress bar, while you are using mysql database, and have to dump the data.

### 🎨 Hobbies

While my days are filled with the pursuit of technological mastery, my life outside the IDE is equally vibrant and full of adventure. Here's a glimpse into what fuels my creativity and passion:

- 🏋️ **Gym Enthusiast**: Pushing the limits, one rep at a time. It's not just about building muscles, but also about fortifying the mind and endurance for those long coding sessions.
- 🚴 **Cycling Voyager**: There's something about the rush of wind as I pedal through scenic routes that invigorates my soul and sparks innovative ideas.
- 🥾 **Hiking Adventurer**: Scaling peaks and traversing valleys, each hike offers a fresh perspective, reminding me that every challenge, like every mountain, can be conquered.
- 🌱 **Plant Gardener**: Nurturing plants from seedlings to full bloom is a reminder of the patience and care that goes into cultivating projects and watching them grow.
- ☕ **Coffee Connoisseur**: Exploring the world one cup of coffee at a time. It's my liquid inspiration, turning each sip into a source of creative energy.

These activities recharge my batteries and inspire my work, reminding me that the journey is just as important as the destination. Whether it's the discipline from the gym, the freedom of cycling, the perseverance from hiking, the patience from gardening, or the creativity fueled by coffee, each hobby adds a unique flavor to my code.
